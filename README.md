# Welcome to the Notebook for 'Case Study' with the `telco.csv` Dataset

## Objective
This repository aims to analyse the `telco.csv` data, extract relevant insights, and present visualisations in a structured report format.

## Guiding Questions
Some key questions to guide the analysis:

- **Which services have the highest churn rate?**
- **What actions can be taken to reduce churn?**
- **What long-term strategies can be implemented to minimise churn in the future?**

## Steps to Follow
The expected outcome is a structured report containing:

1. **Visualisations**: Graphs that illustrate key findings and help communicate insights clearly.
2. **Insights and Recommendations**: Conclusions based on the analysis to help reduce churn.

By following these objectives, I aim to extract valuable insights that can support strategic decision-making for customer retention.
